# Blazor

- `two-way binding` is required for parent and child component communication.
- `cascading` can be used for having multiple components bounded together.
- `R.I.P.` method for the attributes protection.


## Double checks
- `Multi-threaded rendering` needs to be checked closely.

## Data binding
- `Blazor` provides a suitable way to bind data for binding the data values to the variable in the class.

## Event handling
- `MouseEventArgs` is automatically added by the Blazor runtime.
- `Javascript` runs on the client, whereas `Blazor` server app runs on the server.
I will have to finish the blazor tutorial as soon as possible!

### Notes for Sandvik Coromant learning training materials.  
`ActivePageProvider`:
- Add navmenu items

```{cs}
<Tile CssClass="grs-1 gcs-1 gre-end gre-end">
Some code here!
</Tile>
```
- rem and font-size

## Bobben
- Use data from the sensor to move the cursor and map onto the tile and so on. 

## To check
- component lifecycle
-

## Fix CA certificate issue
- `conda config --set ssl_verify certificate.crt`
